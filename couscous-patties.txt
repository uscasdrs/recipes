Servings: 30
Ingredients:
10 oz Couscous
1 ts Mustard seeds
6 Green chillies
1/2 c Urad dahl
1 1" piece of ginger
3 Dry red chillies
Salt; to taste
Curry leaves (2-3 sprigs)
2 ts Vegetable oil
2 tb Coconut (optional)


Instructions:

You will be able to get mustard seeds, curry leaves and urad dahl 
in any local Indian store. 

Save about 2 tsp of urad dahl and soak the rest of the urad dahl 
in water for about an hour. 

After an hour, grind the urad dahl, green chillies and ginger to the 
consistency of pancake batter and keep aside. 

In a pan, heat the 2 tsp veg oil and add the mustard seeds, 2 tsp urad dahl 
(that was saved), the curry leaves and the red chillies (after cutting them 
into fine pieces). 

When the mustard seeds start spluttering and the urad dahl starts turning 
golden brown, add 3 1/2 cups of water and the urad dahl batter, mix well 
and close the pan. 

When the water starts boiling, add salt. (The batter already added will 
tend to form clusters- Don't worry - Can be fixed later) 

Add the couscous and mix thoroughly (use a potato masher and get rid of any 
clusters by mashing them well). 

After the mixture has solidified, (This should not take more than 5-10 
minutes) take the pan out of the heat and let cool. 

After the mixture has cooled, take a small portion of the mixture and make 
into a patty and set aside. 

(You can use some water and/or oil to make the patties if the batter is too 
sticky) 

The amounts mentioned in this recipe should yield about 30 patties. 

Serve with sphaghetti sauce or any spicy chutney. 

WARNING: If you don't like spicy food, reduce the number of green and 
red chillies.
